The AWS App Mesh Kubernetes sidecar injecting Admission Controller.

## Security disclosures

If you think youâ€™ve found a potential security issue, please do not post it in the Issues.  Instead, please follow the instructions [here](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/) or [email AWS security directly](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).

## Prerequisites
* [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/source/)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

## Install

To deploy the sidecar injector you must export the name of your new mesh
```
$ export MESH_NAME=my_mesh_name
```

(Optional) To enable stats_tags on sidecar (Envoy) use
```
$ export ENABLE_STATS_TAGS=true
```

(Optional) To enable the xray-daemon sidecar injection use
```
$ export INJECT_XRAY_SIDECAR=true
```

Now you can deploy the appmesh injector

### Option 1: clone the repository

```bash
$ make deploy
```

This will bootstrap the required certificates and start the sidecar injector in
your cluster.

To cleanup you can run
```
$ make clean
```

### Option 2: download and execute the install script
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-inject/master/hack/install.sh | bash
```

To cleanup you can run
```
kubectl delete namespace appmesh-inject; kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration aws-app-mesh-inject; 
kubectl delete clusterrolebindings aws-app-mesh-inject-binding; kubectl delete clusterrole aws-app-mesh-inject-cr;
```


## Under the hood
### Enable Sidecar injection

To enable sidecar injection for a namespace, you need to label the namespace with `appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook=enabled`

```
kubectl label namespace appmesh-demo appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook=enabled
```

### Default behavior and how to override

Sidecars will be injected to all new pods in the namespace that has enabled sidecar injector webhook. To disable injecting the sidecar 
to particular pods in that namespace, add `appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook: disabled` annotation to the pod spec. 

All container ports defined in the pod spec will be passed to sidecars as application ports. 
To override, add `appmesh.k8s.aws/ports: "<ports>"` annotation to the pod spec. 

The name of the controller that creates the pod will be used as virtual node name and pass over to the sidecar. For example, if a pod 
is created by a deployment, the virtual node name will be `<deployment name>-<namespace>`. 
To override, add `appmesh.k8s.aws/virtualNode: <virtual node name>` annotation to the pod spec. 

The mesh name provided at install time can be overridden with the `appmesh.k8s.aws/mesh: <mesh name>` annotation.

For example:
```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        appmesh.k8s.aws/mesh: my-mesh
        appmesh.k8s.aws/ports: "8079,8080"
        appmesh.k8s.aws/virtualNode: my-app
        appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook: disabled
```
